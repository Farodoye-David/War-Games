Card War Game

A simple card game simulation built in Python and presented in a Jupyter Notebook. The classic "War" card game is played between two players, where each draws a card and the higher card wins. This project demonstrates Python class usage, loops, and game logic in a clean and interactive format.

📂 Project Contents
card_war_game.ipynb – Jupyter notebook with the complete implementation and explanation.

README.md – This file, giving an overview of the project.

🎮 How the Game Works
. A standard deck of 52 cards is created.

. The deck is shuffled and split evenly between two players.

. In each round:

- Both players draw the top card of their deck.

- The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards.

- In case of a tie, a "war" is triggered where each player places down more cards to break the tie.

- The game continues until one player runs out of cards.

🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Classes and Instances

- List operations

- Loops and conditionals

- Randomization

- Game logic and control flow

🚀 Getting Started
. Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x

- Jupyter Notebook (pip install notebook or use Anaconda)

- Running the Notebook:
1. Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Farodoye-David/War-Games.git
cd War-Games

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
- jupyter notebook

3. Open card_war_game.ipynb and run the cells.

💡 Future Improvements
Add a GUI using tkinter or pygame

Track and visualize scores over time

Support multiplayer or CPU-vs-CPU mode
